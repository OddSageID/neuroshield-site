        <h2>A Pattern of Vulnerability</h2>
        <p>Faith-based institutions have become high-value targets in an escalating cyber conflict, while their technologists who prioritize ethics face systematic displacement from the industry.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Incident Timeline</h2>
        <ol class="timeline">
          <li>
            <span class="timeline-date">July 2020</span>
            <span class="timeline-title">Vatican Cyberattack</span>
            <p>Sophisticated breach targeting Holy See networks. Attack vectors exploited legacy security architecture. Demonstrated urgent need for adaptive defense systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Exposed vulnerability of institutions relying on outdated security models.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="timeline-date">2020&ndash;2024</span>
            <span class="timeline-title">LDS/BYU Breaches</span>
            <p>Multiple incidents targeting Latter-day Saints educational and ecclesiastical systems. Patient data, student records, and institutional communications compromised. Traditional signature-based defenses failed against polymorphic threats.</p>
            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Confirmed pattern across faith traditions.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="timeline-date">2025</span>
            <span class="timeline-title">Healthcare AI Authorization Crisis</span>
            <p>Unregulated AI systems generating prior authorization denials without human review. Denial rates 16 times higher than manual systems (American Medical Association, 2025). Physicians describe "automated denial at scale."</p>
            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Technology optimized for profit, not patient care.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="timeline-date">November 2025</span>
            <span class="timeline-title">Vatican Conference on AI and Medicine</span>
            <p>Global faith leaders convened to address AI ethics. Catholic, LDS, Orthodox, Protestant institutions demonstrated existing ecumenical collaboration. Confirmed alignment on principles.</p>
            <p><strong>Gap Identified:</strong> No operational infrastructure to implement shared values.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="callout callout-stat">
          <span class="stat-number">50%+</span>
          <p>of global web traffic is now automated bots (Thales Group, 2025)</p>
          <p>Traditional human-speed defenses cannot counter machine-speed attacks.</p>

        <h2>The Human Cost</h2>
        <p>While institutions face digital threats, the technologists capable of defending them face a different crisis:</p>

        <h3>Displacement of Ethical Technologists</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>AI ethics team members laid off from major tech companies</li>
          <li>Industry blacklisting for whistleblowing or refusing unethical projects</li>
          <li>Significant student debt with no income pathway</li>
          <li>Financial coercion forcing compromise of principles</li>
          <li>No institutional sanctuary or protected employment</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The Result:</strong> Those most qualified to build ethical systems are systematically removed from the field.</p>

          <p><strong>Only 9%</strong> of Americans always read privacy policies before agreeing (Pew Research, 2019)</p>
          <p>The "click to agree" culture has automated away deliberation, normalizing passive consent to corporate control.</p>
          <p><strong>Who is building the systems that exploit this vulnerability?</strong> Not the technologists who were fired for raising concerns.</p>

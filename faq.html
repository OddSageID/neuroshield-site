        <h2>For Potential Sponsors</h2>

        <details>
          <summary>Why should we fund this instead of hiring security consultants?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Consultants build temporary solutions optimized for billable hours. The Order builds permanent infrastructure aligned with your values, staffed by technologists you've liberated from corporate coercion.</p>
            <h4>Cost Comparison:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Major cybersecurity consulting firm:</strong> $500K&ndash;$2M/year, ongoing</li>
              <li><strong>The Order:</strong> $270K/year per technologist (including debt relief), permanent capability building</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Value Difference:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Consultants:</strong> Profit-driven, temporary, black-box solutions</li>
              <li><strong>The Order:</strong> Mission-aligned, permanent, transparent systems</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How do we ensure quality and accountability?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Three-layer governance:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Technical:</strong> Peer review, code audits, performance metrics</li>
              <li><strong>Ethical:</strong> External ethics board reviews, transparency reports</li>
              <li><strong>Institutional:</strong> Sponsor governance board oversight</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Plus: Probationary periods, renewable contracts, clear performance standards.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What's our liability if systems fail or cause harm?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Shared governance structure distributes responsibility appropriately:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Technical failures:</strong> Order maintains professional liability insurance</li>
              <li><strong>Deployment decisions:</strong> Sponsoring institution retains control</li>
              <li><strong>Ethical violations:</strong> Joint accountability with remediation protocols</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Legal structure creates separation between Order operations and sponsor liability while maintaining oversight.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Can we terminate our sponsorship if we're not satisfied?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Yes. Sponsorship agreements include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Annual review periods</li>
              <li>90-day notice for withdrawal</li>
              <li>Transition plans for sponsored technologists</li>
              <li>Prorated refunds for unused funds (if applicable)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We want committed sponsors, not reluctant ones.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How many sponsors are already committed?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Current status: Exploratory discussions with multiple institutions across Catholic, LDS, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions.</p>
            <p>This is founding stage. Early sponsors have maximum influence on structure and direction.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <h2>For Potential Recruits</h2>

        <details>
          <summary>Is this just a non-profit with lower pay?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>No. Salary + debt relief = competitive total compensation.</p>
            <h4>Comparison:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Big Tech:</strong> $150K salary + ethical compromise + risk of termination</li>
              <li><strong>The Order:</strong> $90K salary + $40K debt relief = $130K total + protected employment + meaningful work</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Plus: When your debt is eliminated (3&ndash;5 years), your effective lifetime earnings are higher.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What if I don't want to commit to 5 years?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Initial commitment is 2 years. After that, annual renewals up to 10 years total.</p>
            <p>You can leave at any time. Debt relief already received is not clawed back, but future payments stop.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>I'm an atheist. Is that a problem?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>No. The Order operates under faith sponsorship but does not require members to hold religious belief.</p>
            <p><strong>Required:</strong> Respect for the mission (ethical AI aligned with human dignity)</p>
            <p><strong>Not required:</strong> Personal religious faith</p>
            <p>We have technologists across the belief spectrum, from devout to atheist, united by shared values about technology's role in society.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What if I'm blacklisted by tech companies? Can I still apply?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Yes. In fact, that's often evidence of the ethical courage we're looking for.</p>
            <p>"Blacklisting" usually means: "Refused to compromise and paid the price."</p>
            <p>The Order doesn't care about your standing with corporations. We care about your technical competence and ethical track record.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Can I publish research and present at conferences?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Yes. Encouraged and supported.</p>
            <p>The Order values:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Open-source contribution</li>
              <li>Academic publication</li>
              <li>Conference presentations</li>
              <li>Industry standard-setting</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your work should influence the field, not be hidden.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What if a corporate job offers me more money later?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>We hope you stay for the mission. But we're realistic.</p>
            <p>If you receive a compelling offer:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>No penalty for leaving (beyond losing future debt relief)</li>
              <li>We'll provide references</li>
              <li>Door remains open for potential return</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We want people who want to be here.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How do I know this isn't a scam or will collapse in a year?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Legitimate concern. We provide:</p>
            <h4>Verification:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Legal entity documents (501c3 or equivalent)</li>
              <li>Sponsoring institution letters of commitment</li>
              <li>Financial transparency reports</li>
              <li>Governance board member contacts</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Protections:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Employment contracts include severance</li>
              <li>Debt relief already provided is never reclaimed</li>
              <li>Insurance coverage for operational continuity</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Transparency:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Public quarterly reports</li>
              <li>Open board meetings (observer access)</li>
              <li>Financial statements available to applicants</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We're building for decades, not months.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What's the catch?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>The "catch": You must build excellent systems. Performance standards are high.</p>
            <p>This is sanctuary for principled competence, not incompetence.</p>
            <p>If you can't meet technical standards, don't actually prioritize ethics in practice, create conflict without cause, or underperform consistently&mdash;you won't last.</p>
            <p>We're protecting you so you can do excellent work, not mediocre work.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Can I work remotely?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Depends on project and sponsor requirements.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Cybersecurity for specific institution:</strong> May require on-site presence</li>
              <li><strong>R&amp;D and tool development:</strong> Often remote-friendly</li>
              <li><strong>Healthcare AI implementation:</strong> Hybrid likely</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Discussed during application process based on your role and needs.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What if the Order loses funding or fails?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Risk mitigation:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Diversified sponsorship:</strong> Multiple institutions, not single point of failure</li>
              <li><strong>Endowment building:</strong> Year 1&ndash;3 focus on sustainability</li>
              <li><strong>Contractual protections:</strong> Severance included in employment agreements</li>
              <li><strong>Debt relief guarantee:</strong> Any payments made are never reclaimed</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Worst case: You received debt relief + salary + meaningful work for however long the Order lasted. You're still better off than staying in corporate environment that fired you for ethics.</p>

        <h2>General Questions</h2>

        <details>
          <summary>How is the Order different from existing AI ethics initiatives?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Most initiatives are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Academic:</strong> Research without implementation</li>
              <li><strong>Corporate:</strong> Ethics teams with no authority</li>
              <li><strong>Governmental:</strong> Policy without technical capability</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Order is:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Operational:</strong> Actually building systems</li>
              <li><strong>Protected:</strong> Institutional backing prevents corporate pressure</li>
              <li><strong>Technical:</strong> Staffed by experienced builders</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We don't just study ethical AI. We build it.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What's the long-term vision?</summary>
          <div>
            <h4>Years 1&ndash;5: Proof of concept</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Build core systems for sponsor institutions</li>
              <li>Demonstrate model works</li>
              <li>Refine governance and operations</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Years 6&ndash;10: Expansion and replication</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>License systems to external organizations</li>
              <li>Revenue generation toward sustainability</li>
              <li>Additional cohorts and specializations</li>
              <li>Model replication in other regions</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Years 11+: Institutional permanence</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Financial self-sustainability</li>

              <li>Influence on AI development worldwide</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Ultimate goal:</strong> Make ethical AI infrastructure so robust that the Order becomes obsolete because the principles are universally implemented.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Who's behind this?</summary>
          <div>
            <p>Current status: Founding team includes technologists with ethical track records, faith institution representatives, academic advisors, and legal and policy experts.</p>

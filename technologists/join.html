        <h2>You've Read This Far</h2>
        <p>That means something.</p>
        <p>You haven't dismissed this as idealistic fantasy. You haven't clicked away in cynicism. You're still reading.</p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>Because some part of you recognizes this is what you've been looking for.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A way to be both ethical and employed.</li>
          <li>A path that doesn't require financial martyrdom.</li>
          <li>A community that values what got you fired.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The path exists. The question is whether you'll walk it.</strong></p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 1: Expression of Interest</h2>
        <p>Not an application. Just a conversation.</p>

        <div class="card">
          <p>We'll ask:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your background and expertise</li>
            <li>What ethical concerns led to your departure</li>
            <li>What kind of systems you want to build</li>
            <li>What questions you have about the Order</li>
          </ul>
          <p>No commitment. No pressure. Just dialogue.</p>
          <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> We'll respond within one week to schedule a call.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="btn-group">
          <a href="../contact.html" class="btn btn-recruit">Express Interest</a>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 2: Exploratory Call</h2>
        <p>30-minute video conversation with Order leadership.</p>

        <div class="card">
          <p>We'll discuss:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your specific situation and needs</li>
            <li>Whether the Order is the right fit</li>
            <li>What projects align with your expertise</li>
            <li>The application process if you want to proceed</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>This is mutual discernment.</strong> We're not just evaluating you&mdash;you're evaluating us.</p>
          <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> If both sides are interested, move to application.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

        <h2>Step 3: Formal Application</h2>

        <div class="card">

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Technical portfolio:</strong> Code samples, projects, publications</li>
            <li><strong>Professional references:</strong> 2&ndash;3 people who can attest to your ethics and competence</li>
            <li><strong>Personal statement:</strong> Why the Order, what you hope to build</li>
            <li><strong>Verification of ethical departure:</strong> Documentation of whistleblowing, termination for principled refusal, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Review Process</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Technical assessment:</strong> Can you actually build these systems?</li>
            <li><strong>Ethics verification:</strong> Do you have demonstrated track record?</li>
            <li><strong>Values alignment interview:</strong> Are we mission-compatible?</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 4&ndash;6 weeks from application to decision.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Step 4: Onboarding</h2>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <details>
          <summary>What if I don't have student debt?</summary>
          <p>Salary adjustment compensates, or you can direct "debt relief" funds to dependents' education.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>I'm not religious. Is this a problem?</summary>
          <p>No. The Order operates under faith sponsorship but does not require members to hold religious belief. Respect for the mission and values is required; personal faith is not.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What if I want to leave before 5 years?</summary>
          <p>You can separate at any time. Debt relief received to that point is not clawed back, but future payments cease. No penalty beyond losing the benefit.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What if I'm offered a better-paying job elsewhere?</summary>
          <p>We hope you stay for the mission, not just the money. But we're also realistic&mdash;if a truly compelling opportunity arises, we can discuss transition.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How do I know this is real and not a scam?</summary>
          <p>Valid concern. We provide: verifiable sponsoring institution documentation, legal entity formation documents, financial transparency, references from governance board members, and video calls with leadership before any commitment.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What if the Order fails or loses funding?</summary>
          <p>Employment contracts include severance provisions. Any debt relief already provided is not reclaimed. We're building for sustainability, but we acknowledge the risk.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Can I work remotely?</summary>
          <p>Depends on project. Some work requires on-site presence at sponsor institutions. Other work can be remote. We'll discuss during exploratory call.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What's the catch?</summary>
          <p>The "catch" is this: You must actually build excellent ethical systems. Performance standards are high. This isn't a refuge for incompetence&mdash;it's a sanctuary for principled competence.</p>
        </details>

        <h2>What Happens Next</h2>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>If you do nothing:</h3>
          <p>The financial pressure continues. The job market for ethical technologists remains hostile. The cage gets built by those willing to compromise.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>If you take the first step:</h3>
          <p>Expression of interest &rarr; Exploratory call &rarr; Potential pathway to protected, meaningful work &rarr; Systems that serve human flourishing &rarr; Liberation from financial coercion &rarr; Community of aligned technologists</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>The choice is yours.</strong></p>

      <section>
        <h2>The Final Question</h2>
        <p>Years from now, what will you tell yourself about this moment?</p>
        <p><em>"I read about the Order, but I was too afraid to reach out."</em></p>
        <p>Or</p>
        <p><em>"I read about the Order, and I took the first step toward building the shield instead of the cage."</em></p>
        <p><strong>The path exists. Will you walk it?</strong></p>

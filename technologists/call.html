      <section>
        <h2>They Called It "Not Being a Team Player"</h2>
        <p>You raised concerns about bias in the algorithm. You questioned whether the model was optimizing for patient outcomes or profit margins. You asked if users truly understood what they were consenting to.</p>
        <p>And for that, you were terminated.</p>
        <p>They dressed it up in corporate language&mdash;"organizational restructuring," "shifting priorities," "cultural fit"&mdash;but you know the truth:</p>
        <p><strong>You were fired for choosing ethics over expedience.</strong></p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="weight-heading">
        <h2 id="weight-heading">The Weight You Carry</h2>
        <p><strong>$150,000 in student debt.</strong><br>
        Six years of education to become the kind of technologist who could build systems that actually help people.</p>

        <p><strong>No income.</strong><br>
        Blacklisted from an industry that values compliance over conscience.</p>

        <p><strong>Financial coercion.</strong><br>
        The weight of debt doesn't care about your principles. It demands you find work, any work, even if it means building exactly what you refused to build before.</p>

        <p><strong>The cage tightens.</strong></p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="not-alone-heading">
        <h2 id="not-alone-heading">You Are Not Alone</h2>
        <p>Across the industry, ethical AI researchers, cybersecurity specialists, and principled engineers face the same choice:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Compromise your values and keep your job</li>
          <li>Stand firm and lose everything</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Google's AI ethics team: <strong>Disbanded</strong> after raising concerns</p>
        <p>Meta's responsible AI division: <strong>Gutted</strong> in layoffs</p>
        <p>OpenAI's safety researchers: <strong>Departed</strong> after policy disagreements</p>
        <p>Healthcare AI whistleblowers: <strong>Terminated, sued, silenced</strong></p>

        <p><strong>The pattern is clear:</strong> Corporations systematically remove those who prioritize human dignity over profit.</p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="knowledge-heading">
        <h2 id="knowledge-heading">What You Know That Others Don't</h2>
        <p>You've seen the code. You understand what behavioral AI can do when deployed without oversight:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pre-conscious manipulation through interface design</li>
          <li>Automated institutional decay in healthcare</li>
          <li>Cognitive exploitation at infrastructure level</li>
          <li>Erosion of human autonomy disguised as convenience</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You know that the systems currently being built don't just influence behavior&mdash;they predict and preempt choice itself.</p>
        <p>You know that without transparent, human-augmented oversight, AI becomes not a tool for empowerment but an instrument of control.</p>
        <p><strong>You know the difference between the shield and the cage.</strong></p>
        <p>And you refused to build the cage.</p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="question-heading">
        <h2 id="question-heading">The Question You Face</h2>
        <p>How long can you hold out?</p>
        <p>How many months before the debt collectors escalate?</p>
        <p>How many rejections before you accept a position that requires you to compromise?</p>
        <p>How many nights of anxiety before you give in?</p>
        <p>Financial pressure is a weapon. It has been used against you with precision.</p>
        <p><strong>But there is another path.</strong></p>
